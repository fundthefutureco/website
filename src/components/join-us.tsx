              Our mission is to bridge the gap between students and real-world experiences by providing financial support for extracurricular activities that enrich studentsâ€™ educational journeys. Through our grants, we aim to expand opportunity for everyone, fostering creativity and personal growth in our youth. Through our educational mission, we also seek to expand fundraising as a viable financial solution for this financial barrier through education, building high school chapters across the state.
